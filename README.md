NaNoGenMo2017: Mario's Big Adventure

This is a procedurally-generated novel output from a lua script that watches a user play Super Mario Bros for the NES on the FCEUX emulator. 

When events in the game occur, the script will listen for changes in the RAM table and output text to a file, recording Mario's journey in a narrative style.

To use the script, you must use the FCEUX NES emulator (available on all platforms) and... "find" a copy of a super mario bros 1 rom (only tested with JUST SMB1 and not duck hunt/combo cart). The Japanese and English release are essentially identical.

## Requirements

1) FCEUX

2) Super Mario Bros. ROM

3) gen.lua

## Directions:

1) Clone the repo 

2) Start up FCEUX.

3) Load the game, quickly load gen.lua, and start playing. The text written to the emu message field will be also written to file.
