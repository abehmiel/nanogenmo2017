NaNoGenMo2017: Mario's Big Adventure

This is a procedurally-generated novel output from a lua script that watches a user play Super Mario Bros for the NES on the FCEUX emulator. 

When events in the game occur, the script will listen for changes in the RAM table and output text to a file, recording Mario's journey in a narrative style.
